It asked a crumb of me. 
Yet, never, in extremity, 
And on the strangest sea; 
I've heard it in the chillest land, 
That kept so many warm. 
That could abash the little bird 
And sore must be the storm 
And sweetest in the gale is heard; 
And never stops at all, 
And sings the tune without the words, 
That perches in the soul, 
HOPE is the thing with feathers 
Hope by Emily Dickinson: 
My name is Bracha Glazer.
I like this poem because it brings back memories of high school, when I first heard this poem.
